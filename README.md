WELCOME TO FLUTTER BLOC

HERE IS A SIMPLE LOGIC ON HOW FLUTTEER BLOC WORKS

I have made it simple by not working of request logic so you can only find the logic on how cubit works with UI/Presentation/Screen works.

You can find the initial screen what is displayed when you open your app. --> The initial color.

Then there is the fetching screen what happens when you open our application. --> Loading Circular Progress Indicator shown for 1 sec.

Also you can file the new screen when the data is fetched and the screen is loaded. --> Now Color which has been generated form the random call provided by flutter. --> After calling the new color application screen state calls the new color screen which can be displayed after the circular progress bar has completed.
